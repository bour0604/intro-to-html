            <p>Hello! My name is Charlotte and I am 18 years old. I am french canadian, and french is my native language. I like music, coffee, hanging out with my cat, and playing video games. I spend a lot of money on concerts and trinkets.</p>

            <p>This is my cat Pepper. He is 6. He is fat.</p>

            <p>I signed up for the Graphic Design program after I spent a year as a COOP student with Rogers TV. With my classmates, we produced a tv show that was broadcasted on the Rogers channel. My teacher inspired me to pursue Graphic Design as I was often the chosen one to make the posters, logos, and graphic elements in our show.</p>
